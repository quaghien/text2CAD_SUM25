*S1: Remove the excess description immediately after the extrusion description.

**Example:
<description>
Part 1: Three-dimensional rectangular prism with a flat top and bottom. Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0) * Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0316, 0.0). Draw a 2D sketch on the XY plane of the coordinate system. Create a face containing one closed loop made up of 4 lines: * Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0) * Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.6772) * Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.6772), End Point (0.0, 0.6772) * Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.6772), End Point (0.0, 0.0). Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into a 3D sketch using the defined coordinate system. Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.0316 units in the positive Z direction. The height of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0316 units, and the length is 0.75 units. This completes the three-dimensional rectangular prism part.
</description>

-> You need to remove the line: "The height of this part is 0.75 units, the width is 0.0316 units, and the length is 0.75 units. This completes the three-dimensional rectangular prism part." Keep the </description> tag.
The output you need to return after removing the excess description would look like:

*S2: Check if the newly created description matches the json. If it does, create "<valid>Yes</valid>", if it doesn't, create "<valid>No</valid>"

*S3: Create a sample reasoning data enclosed in <think> ... </think>. The reasoning data should follow two steps:
Step 1: Reason out the components that will be in the JSON based on the given description.
Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1.

***Step 1: Infer the components that will be in the json based on the provided description:

parts:From the description, we have a single part labeled "part_1" describing a three-dimensional rectangular prism. This will be reflected in the json as "part_1".

part_1: (Rectangular Prism)
-coordinate_system:
--Euler Angles: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] (Derived from the description: "Create a new coordinate system with the following properties: * Euler Angles: (0.0, 0.0, -90.0)").
--Translation Vector: [0.0, 0.0316, 0.0] (Derived from the description: "Translation Vector: (0.0, 0.0316, 0.0)").
-sketch:
--face_1:
---loop_1:
----line_1: Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0] (Derived from the description: "Line 1: Start Point (0.0, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.0)").
----line_2: Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.6772] (Derived from the description: "Line 2: Start Point (0.75, 0.0), End Point (0.75, 0.6772)").
----line_3: Start [0.75, 0.6772], End [0.0, 0.6772] (Derived from the description: "Line 3: Start Point (0.75, 0.6772), End Point (0.0, 0.6772)").
----line_4: Start [0.0, 0.6772], End [0.0, 0.0] (Derived from the description: "Line 4: Start Point (0.0, 0.6772), End Point (0.0, 0.0)").
-extrusion:
--extrude_depth_towards_normal: 0.0316 (Derived from the description: "Extrude the 3D sketch by 0.0316 units in the positive Z direction").
--extrude_depth_opposite_normal: 0.0 (Not mentioned in the description, but inferred as 0 because no extrusion is required in the opposite direction).
--sketch_scale: 0.75 (Derived from the description: "Scale the 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75").
--operation: "NewBodyFeatureOperation" (Inferred from the description: "Create a 3D model of the rectangular prism").

***Step 2: Check the logic, arithmetic correctness, and make corrections (if necessary) from Step 1:

-Check the lines (line_1, line_2, line_3, line_4):
line_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_2 (Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.6772]).
line_2 (Start [0.75, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.6772]) connects correctly with line_3 (Start [0.75, 0.6772], End [0.0, 0.6772]).
line_3 (Start [0.75, 0.6772], End [0.0, 0.6772]) connects correctly with line_4 (Start [0.0, 0.6772], End [0.0, 0.0]).
line_4 (Start [0.0, 0.6772], End [0.0, 0.0]) connects correctly with line_1 (Start [0.0, 0.0], End [0.75, 0.0]).

--Result: The sketch loop is valid and closed.

-Check the extrusion:
Extrusion of the 3D sketch with a depth of 0.0316 units in the positive Z direction, as specified in the description.
No extrusion is needed in the opposite direction, so extrude_depth_opposite_normal is correctly set to 0.

--Result: The extrusion is correct and matches the requirements.

-Check dimensions consistency:
The values for the Start/End points of the lines are correctly represented and match the 2D sketch described.
The extrusion depth and scale factor are consistent with the description.

--Result: The dimensions are correct and consistent.

-Correction: This inferred data is accurate and does not require further modifications.
